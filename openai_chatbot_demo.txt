Hi, shall I ask some question about making new friends at a new environment?
This is Chatbot's answer: Of course! I'd be happy to help you with questions about making new friends in a new environment. It's a common challenge when moving to a new place or starting a new job or school.
Do you have further question? 
I am too shy to reach out to new people.
This is Chatbot's answer: I understand how you're feeling, and it's completely normal to feel shy or nervous about reaching out to new people. Here are some strategies that might help:

1. Reach out to others: Even if it feels difficult, try to connect with friends or family through phone calls, video chats, or social media platforms. You don't have to meet in person if you're not comfortable yet. Just a simple message or call can make a big difference. Join online communities: Look for virtual groups or forums where you can share your interests and experiences. This could be a good way to meet new people in a less intimidating environment. Check in with people you know: When you’ve been isolated, it’s easy to feel that people are doing fine without you. But remember, it’s usually not true. Try to overcome this feeling and reach out to them. Stay Positive and Patient: Building meaningful connections takes time and effort. It's completely okay to take small steps at a time. Be patient with yourself and others, and try to stay positive throughout the process. Remember that it's okay to feel shy and it's okay to take your time. You're not alone in this, and there are many resources and people who can help.
Do you have further question? 
What if I do not have common words with surrounding people since I am in a foreign country?
This is Chatbot's answer: That's a very common challenge when living in a foreign country, and there are many ways to navigate it:

1. Language learning: If language is a barrier, consider taking language classes or using language learning apps. This can also be a great way to meet others who are also learning the language. Connecting over shared interests: Even if you don't share a common language, shared interests can be a great way to connect. Look for local groups or events that align with your hobbies or passions. Cultural exchange: Embrace the opportunity to learn about a new culture and share your own. This can often lead to interesting conversations and connections. Patience and understanding: Communication might be difficult at times, but many people appreciate the effort you're making to connect with them. Be patient with yourself and others. Use technology: There are many translation apps and tools that can help bridge the language gap. Remember, everyone has been a newcomer at some point, and most people will understand and be patient with you. Don't be too hard on yourself, and give yourself credit for the steps you're taking to build new connections.
Do you have further question? 
I feel too lonely and depressed in a foreign country!
This is Chatbot's answer: I'm really sorry that you're feeling this way, but I'm unable to provide the help that you need. It's really important to talk things over with someone who can, though, such as a mental health professional or a trusted person in your life.
